# Supabase anon key is a publishable key (like Stripe pk_*), not a secret
# It's intentionally embedded as a fallback for CLI tools in scripts/auth/config.py
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This rule suppresses JWT token detection globally because:
# 1. The only JWT tokens in this codebase are Supabase anon keys (publishable)
# 2. These are designed to be public (like Stripe pk_* keys)
# 3. They are already embedded in the frontend web/static/js/auth.js
# 4. Real secrets (service_role keys) are in environment variables, never in code
#
# If adding new JWT tokens to the codebase, verify they are also non-secret before committing.
