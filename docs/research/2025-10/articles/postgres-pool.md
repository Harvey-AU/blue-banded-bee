Seven proven Postgres connection-pool fixes for burst traffic. Cut p99s, avoid
connection storms, and keep apps stable with PgBouncer and app-level tweaks.

You know the moment: a promo hits, jobs pile up, dashboards light red.
Connections climb like ivy. Queries slow. Someone whispers “Do we need a bigger
instance?” Maybe. But first — let’s make your pooling sane. Small, surgical
fixes can deliver outsized relief.

Start with a mental model Your app opens sessions; Postgres speaks in
transactions. The pool sits in the middle translating chaos into order. When
bursts arrive, you’re not optimizing for theoretical throughput — you’re
optimizing for time to first byte and fairness. That means right-sizing pools,
shedding work early, and keeping connections hot and short.

1. Move to transaction pooling (and size it like a budget) What changes: Switch
   PgBouncer from session to transaction pooling wherever the app doesn’t rely
   on session-pinned state (temp tables, SET LOCAL quirks, advisory locks
   spanning transactions).

Why it works: Transaction pooling turns long-lived sessions into quick rentals.
Each server connection is reused at the end of a transaction, absorbing bursts
without multiplying database backends.

Numbers to aim for:

App pool max per service: min(2 × vCPU, ¼ of server max_connections) PgBouncer
pool_size: 5–20 per database/user combo (start at 10 and tune) PgBouncer
max_db_connections: protect Postgres (e.g., 1.2× pool_size × services)
PgBouncer.ini (excerpt):

[databases] mydb = host=10.0.0.12 port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer] pool_mode = transaction default_pool_size = 10 max_db_connections =
120 reserve_pool_size = 20 reserve_pool_timeout = 5 server_reset_query_always =
1 ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits Caution: If your ORM uses temp
tables or session GUCs, test first. Many apps are fine.

2. Cap concurrency at the app boundary (not the database) What changes: Treat
   your app’s pool as the hard concurrency gate. You don’t want 1,000 web
   workers all knocking on PgBouncer at once.

Node.js (pg) example:

import { Pool } from 'pg'; const pool = new Pool({ connectionString:
process.env.DATABASE_URL, max: parseInt(process.env.DB_POOL_MAX || '20', 10), //
HARD CAP idleTimeoutMillis: 10000, // reclaim idlers quickly
connectionTimeoutMillis: 3000 // fail fast }); Go (pgx) example:

cfg, _ := pgxpool.ParseConfig(os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")) cfg.MaxConns = 20
cfg.MinConns = 4 cfg.MaxConnLifetime = time.Hour cfg.MaxConnIdleTime = 2 *
time.Minute cfg.HealthCheckPeriod = 30 * time.Second pool, _ :=
pgxpool.NewWithConfig(context.Background(), cfg) Why it works: If each service
enforces its own ceiling, PgBouncer queues stay short and fair. It’s better to
return 429s or fallbacks than to melt your database.

3. Set timeouts that protect p99 (and your on-call) Long waits are worse than
   clean failures during a burst. Add three timeouts: acquire, statement, and
   idle-in-transaction.

Database GUCs (safe defaults):

ALTER DATABASE mydb SET statement_timeout = '15000ms'; -- kill runaway queries
ALTER DATABASE mydb SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '5s'; -- no zombie
tx ALTER DATABASE mydb SET lock_timeout = '3s'; -- avoid deadlock purgatory
Client timeouts:

Pool acquire: 2–5s (fail fast if queue is long) Query exec: ~15s for OLTP; lower
if your SLO is tight HTTP request timeout to app: slightly higher than query
timeout Result: Your p99 stops ballooning, and the system self-heals after the
spike.

4. Use prepared statements wisely (and sometimes disable them) Prepared
   statements are great — until they cause bloat or can’t be reused across
   PgBouncer transactions. In transaction pooling, the default pattern of
   session-pinned prepared statements may backfire.

Fixes:

pg (Node) supports statement.prepare cache but consider pgbouncer setting
server_reset_query_always = 1 and app-side preferSimpleProtocol for complex,
highly variable queries: const pool = new Pool({ connectionString:
process.env.DATABASE_URL, statement_timeout: 15000, // Disable extended query
protocol to avoid prepared stmt churn // when your workload is highly ad-hoc:
options: '-c prepare_threshold=0' }); pgx (Go): set PreferSimpleProtocol: true
on bespoke analytics endpoints, leave default elsewhere. When to keep prepared
statements: high-QPS endpoints with stable SQL text and parameters (checkout,
auth). Measure before/after.

5. Split read and write traffic (even if you have one node) What changes: Create
   separate pools for writes and reads (or replica reads). Even on a single
   primary, splitting logical pools avoids write storms starving reads — or vice
   versa.

PgBouncer databases section:

[databases] mydb_rw = host=10.0.0.12 port=5432 dbname=mydb mydb_ro =
host=10.0.0.13 port=5432 dbname=mydb ; replica when available App routing:

Route writes and strongly consistent reads to mydb_rw. Route non-critical, list
views, and background analytics to mydb_ro. If replicas lag, gate endpoints with
feature flags to fall back to rw. Impact: During bursts, catalog pages and
dashboards won’t fight inserts for the same pool slots.

6. Shed work with queue limits and backpressure What changes: Add bounded queues
   at every layer — HTTP worker pool, job queue consumers, and the DB pool. Past
   the cap, you reject quickly or enqueue for later.

n workers × max_inflight × db_pool_max = Your budget.\* Guard it.

Example:

Web: 20 workers × 1 inflight DB op each = 20 max DB concurrency Jobs: 10
consumers × concurrency 2 = 20 DB pool cap = 40 (not 400) Queue behavior:

If pool acquire waits > 2s, return 429 + “retry-after”. If job queue is full,
push to a dead-letter with a retry policy (exponential backoff, max 3). Why it
works: Backpressure preserves latency for users who get through, rather than
slowing everyone to a crawl.

7. Keep transactions tiny (and observable) The most effective “pool fix” is to
   finish transactions fast. Bursts amplify any extra millisecond spent inside a
   transaction: serialization, index lookups, row locks, client round trips.

Tactics:

Move CPU-heavy JSON/XML parsing outside the transaction boundary. Replace N
queries with one batched INSERT ... VALUES, COPY, or UNNEST() parameter arrays.
Use the right isolation: OLTP is usually fine with READ COMMITTED. Add request
IDs and log per-query latency, rows, and locks. Node (pg) with measured
boundaries:

const withTx = async (fn) => { const client = await pool.connect(); try { await
client.query('BEGIN'); const start = Date.now(); const result = await
fn(client); await client.query('COMMIT'); console.log('tx_ms=%d', Date.now() -
start); return result; } catch (e) { await client.query('ROLLBACK'); throw e; }
finally { client.release(); } }; What you’ll see: when transactions drop from
80–120ms to 20–40ms, your pool suddenly feels twice as large during spikes.

Bonus: fast wins that cost almost nothing Increase work_mem carefully via role
or query, not globally. Bigger sorts can speed one query but starve the server.
Right-size max_connections low (100–300) and let PgBouncer multiplex; huge
max_connections piles on context switching. Use prepared + unnest for batch
reads (e.g., get 100 SKUs in one trip). Add statement_timeout to migrations so a
bad index doesn’t pin your pool during traffic. A short field story An
e-commerce team saw checkout p99s jump from 350ms to 2.5s every time they ran a
flash sale. They tried a bigger instance. Marginal improvement. The fix was
mostly discipline: move to transaction pooling, cap app pools at 30 per service,
add a 2s acquire timeout, split read/write pools, and shrink transaction scope
around a hot inventory update. Result: p99s stayed under 600ms during the next
spike, with fewer DB backends than before. No 3 a.m. heroics required.
