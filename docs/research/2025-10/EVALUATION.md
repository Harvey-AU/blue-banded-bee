# Reference Articles Evaluation

**Project**: Blue Banded Bee - Cache Warming Service **Evaluation Date**: 12
October 2025 **Evaluator**: System Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates recommendations from 10 reference articles against Blue
Banded Bee's architecture, current implementation, and roadmap.

### Scoring System (0-5 scale)

- **Relevance**: How applicable to our cache warming service with worker pools
- **Current**: Extent already implemented (0 = not at all, 5 = fully done)
- **Impact**: Potential benefit if implemented
- **Effort**: Work required to implement (0 = trivial, 5 = major)

## Blue Banded Bee Context (For Reference)

### Current Architecture

- **Language**: Go 1.25
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Deployment**: Fly.io with Cloudflare CDN
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (JWT)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (errors + performance)
- **Testing**: 350+ tests, 38.9% coverage, testify framework

### Key Components

- Worker pool with concurrent task processing
- FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED for lock-free queuing
- Connection pooling (25 max open, 10 idle)
- Goroutine-based concurrency with context
- RESTful API with middleware
- Batch operations for efficiency

### Current Patterns

- Extract + Test + Commit refactoring methodology
- Function size < 50 lines
- Table-driven tests
- Error wrapping with context
- Sentry for critical failures only
