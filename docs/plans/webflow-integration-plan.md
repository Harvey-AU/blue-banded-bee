# Cache Warming App for Webflow - Integration Plan

## Overview

This app solves a critical problem for Webflow sites: when a site is published, the CDN cache is cleared, causing the first visitors to experience slow load times while pages are regenerated and cached. Additionally, publishing can sometimes introduce errors that aren't immediately apparent.

Our solution:
- Automatically crawls the entire site immediately after publishing
- Warms the cache so real visitors get fast load times from the first click
- Detects any errors before real users encounter them
- Shows real-time progress directly in the Webflow Designer
- Allows for scheduled maintenance crawls (daily/weekly/monthly)

## Core Requirements
1. Install once in Webflow project
2. Automatically run on every site publish
3. Display real-time progress in Webflow Designer
4. Support scheduled runs (daily, weekly, monthly)

## Technical Implementation Plan

1. **Webflow App Registration**
  - Register as a Webflow developer
  - Create a Data Client App with OAuth support
  - Request scope: `sites:read` only

2. **Automatic Trigger System**
  - Implement webhook subscription for the `site_publish` event
  - Build secure endpoint to receive webhook POST requests
  - Verify webhook signatures using `x-webflow-signature` headers

3. **Scheduling System**
  - Create configuration UI for scheduling options
  - Implement cron-like scheduler for recurring runs
  - Store user preferences in database linked to site ID

4. **Designer Extension UI**
  - Develop Designer Extension with:
    - Progress indicator (orange) showing "xx/yy pages"
    - Success indicator (green) when complete
    - Error indicator (red) with count of issues
    - Expandable error details view
    - Schedule configuration options

5. **Real-time Communication**
  - Implement WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
  - Create API endpoints for the extension to fetch status
  - Build authentication between extension and server

6. **Deployment & Publication**
  - Connect existing crawler to both webhook listener and scheduler
  - Submit app to Webflow for marketplace approval
  - Create simple onboarding flow for new users

This implementation gives users "set and forget" functionality with instant cache warming after publishing plus scheduled maintenance runs at their preferred intervals, all controlled through a simple interface within the Webflow Designer.

## Integration Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Prerequisites |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Webflow App Registration | 1-2 weeks | None |
| Automatic Trigger System | 2-3 weeks | Webflow App Registration, Core API completion |
| Scheduling System | 2 weeks | Database schema finalization |
| Designer Extension UI | 3-4 weeks | Webflow App Registration |
| Real-time Communication | 2-3 weeks | Core API and database layer completion |
| Deployment & Publication | 2-4 weeks | All previous phases |

Total estimated timeline: 12-18 weeks from core API completion
