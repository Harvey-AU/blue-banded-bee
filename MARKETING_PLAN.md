### 1. Key Features & How to Message Them

The trick is to name and describe features based on the *problem they solve*, not just what they *do*.

| Feature Name                          | What It Is (The "How")                                         | The Core Message (The "Why")                                                                                                                                                                           |

### 2. Tiered Plan & Pricing Structure

The goal is to create a ladder where customers can start for free, upgrade when they need automation (the core value), and upgrade again as their needs scale. The value metrics are **pages per crawl**, **number of websites**, and **automation**.
