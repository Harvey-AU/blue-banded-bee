### 1. The Quantifiable Impact of Performance & Reliability

Connecting features to tangible business results is critical. These are the core benefits Blue Banded Bee enables, based on established industry benchmarks.

#### **Boost Your Conversion Rate (CRO)**
*   **The 1-Second Rule:** A 1-second delay in page load time can lead to a **7% reduction in conversions**.
*   **The Bounce Effect:** Page load time going from 1s to 3s increases the probability of a user bouncing by **32%**.
*   **The Bottom Line:** A fast, reliable site builds trust and removes friction from the path to purchase. A broken link isn't an error; it's a guaranteed lost sale for that user's session.

#### **Improve Your SEO Rankings**
*   **Core Web Vitals:** Google uses Core Web Vitals (CWV) as a ranking factor. A faster site directly contributes to better LCP and FID scores.
*   **Maximise Crawl Budget:** Every 404 error is a wasted request from Googlebot. By eliminating these, you ensure Google spends its time indexing your most important content, not chasing dead ends.
*   **User Experience Signals:** A low bounce rate and high time-on-page are positive user signals that Google rewards. Speed and reliability are the foundation for this.

#### **Dramatically Increase Website Speed**
*   **Slash Server Response Time:** Our Instant Post-Publish Speed can reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB) from over 1,000ms to **under 100ms** on new content.
*   **Eliminate the "First Load Penalty":** We ensure the very first visitor to a new page gets the same lightning-fast, cached experience as every subsequent visitor.

### 2. Feature Messaging: From Technical to Tangible

This table translates *what the feature is* into *the value it delivers*.

| Feature Name | The Core Message (The "Why") |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instant Post-Publish Speed** | **"Slash server response time by up to 90%."** By instantly warming your cache, we eliminate the "first load penalty," ensuring your most critical visitors get the fastest possible experience and protecting your Core Web Vitals. |
| **Automated Link Integrity** | **"Stop losing sales and SEO authority to broken links."** We automatically find and report every 404 and 500 error, protecting your customer's path to purchase and ensuring maximum SEO crawl budget. |
| **Intelligent, Prioritised Crawling** | **"Fix what matters most, first."** We don't just scan 10,000 pages. We intelligently test your most important user journeys first, so you can be sure your core business is always online and fast. |
| **Performance Bottleneck Alerts** | **"Find your slowest pages before you lose 7% of your conversions."** Get automatic alerts on pages with slow load times (TTFB, LCP), allowing you to fix them before they impact your bottom line. |
| **Actionable Performance Dashboard** | **"Your website's health, at a glance."** See performance trends over time, track recurring issues, and get a clear, prioritised list of what needs fixing. No more guesswork. |

### 3. Tiered Plan & Pricing Structure

The goal is to create a ladder where customers can start for free, upgrade for automation (the core value), and scale as their needs grow.
