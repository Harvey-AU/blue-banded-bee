  - Mitigation: Implement automated backup schedule and periodic recovery testing

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Sprints)

- [ ] **Production performance under high concurrency**
- [ ] **PostgreSQL connection pooling optimisation**
- [ ] **Worker pool scaling**

### Medium-term (Future Sprints)

- [ ] **Deployment stability on Fly.io**
- [ ] **Auth integration complexity**
- [ ] **Batch processing error handling**

### Long-term (Future Stages)

- [ ] **Paddle webhook handling**
- [ ] **Webflow API limitations**
