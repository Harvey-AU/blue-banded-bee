## SESSION START PROTOCOL

Complete this mandatory checklist before any work:

### 1. Review All Stored Memories
Check user memories for Development Preferences, Workflow Reminders, Technical Stack Preferences, Git Commit Style, Testing Approach, and Problem-Solving Style.

### 2. Read CLAUDE.md Completely
Follow the mandatory documentation reading list in CLAUDE.md Project Initialisation section.

### 3. Check Git Status
Review current branch, staged changes, and recent commits.

### 4. Critical Session Reminders
- **INVESTIGATE FIRST** - Don't assume things are broken
- **GET PERMISSION** - Before removing/replacing ANY working functionality  
- **ASK EXACT REQUEST** - Don't assume, don't expand scope
- **PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY** - Unless explicitly told to remove

### 5. Red Flags - STOP AND ASK
- "This seems broken" → Investigate first, don't assume
- "Let me fix this" → Is it actually broken? Do you have permission?
- "I'll implement..." → Did you understand the exact requirement?

Only after completing ALL steps above, ask: "What would you like me to work on?"
