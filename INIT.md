CRITICAL SESSION START PROTOCOL:

Before doing ANYTHING, complete this checklist:

1. READ @CLAUDE.md COMPLETELY - Follow British English, documentation-first workflow, preserve functionality, investigate before assuming
2. READ @Roadmap.md - Understand current stage and what's actually completed
3. READ @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Understand system design before making changes
4. ASK "What is the user's EXACT request?" - Don't assume, don't expand scope
5. INVESTIGATE FIRST - Check if things are actually broken or just assumed broken
6. GET PERMISSION - Before removing/replacing ANY working functionality

RED FLAGS - STOP AND ASK:

- "This seems broken" → Investigate first, don't assume
- "Let me fix this" → Is it actually broken? Do you have permission?
- "I'll implement..." → Did you understand the exact requirement?

PREVIOUS SESSION FAILURES:

- Replaced working vanilla JS dashboard with broken Web Components without permission
- Didn't follow documentation-first workflow despite it being in CLAUDE.md
- Made user re-explain requirements 4+ times
- Cost $14.33 for mostly circular, destructive work

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Follow exact user request, nothing more
- Preserve all working functionality unless explicitly told to remove it
- Read docs before proposing solutions
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing

This is attempt #4 to fix this pattern. FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL.
