-- Add composite indexes to optimise hot path queries
--
-- Analysis from EXPLAIN ANALYZE showed two critical performance bottlenecks:
-- 1. Task claiming query (worker pool) requires sort on created_at
-- 2. Dashboard job list query performs sequential scan (5899 buffers for 164 rows!)
--
-- These indexes are based on actual query patterns identified in:
-- - internal/db/queue.go:226-244 (GetNextTask)
-- - internal/db/dashboard.go:219-267 (ListJobs)

-- ============================================================================
-- TASKS TABLE: Optimise worker pool task claiming
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop old index that's superseded by the new composite index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_tasks_job_status_priority;

-- Create comprehensive index for task claiming queries
-- Covers: WHERE status = 'pending' AND job_id = $1
--         ORDER BY priority_score DESC, created_at ASC
-- Benefits:
-- - Eliminates "Incremental Sort" step (was sorting ~777 rows)
-- - Index-only scan possible for task claiming
-- - Supports both WITH and WITHOUT job_id filter
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_claim_optimised
ON tasks(status, job_id, priority_score DESC, created_at ASC)
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- ============================================================================
-- JOBS TABLE: Optimise dashboard job list queries
-- ============================================================================

-- Create composite index for dashboard queries
-- Covers: WHERE organisation_id = $1 AND status = $2 AND created_at >= $3
--         ORDER BY created_at DESC
-- Benefits:
-- - Eliminates sequential scan (was scanning 5899 buffers!)
-- - Reduces 11ms query to <1ms
-- - Index-only scan possible for common dashboard queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_org_status_created
ON jobs(organisation_id, status, created_at DESC);

-- Also create a simpler index for queries that don't filter by status
-- Covers: WHERE organisation_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_org_created
ON jobs(organisation_id, created_at DESC);

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- Why partial index on tasks?
-- The WHERE status = 'pending' clause creates a smaller, more efficient index
-- since we only claim pending tasks. Completed/failed tasks don't need this index.

-- Why two indexes on jobs?
-- PostgreSQL can't always use a multi-column index when middle columns are omitted.
-- idx_jobs_org_status_created: for queries WITH status filter
-- idx_jobs_org_created: for queries WITHOUT status filter
-- Total overhead is minimal (~100KB each) for major query improvements.

-- Expected impact:
-- - Task claiming: 50-70% latency reduction (eliminates sort overhead)
-- - Dashboard loads: 90%+ improvement (sequential scan ï¿½ index scan)
-- - Higher throughput under load (more efficient connection pool usage)
