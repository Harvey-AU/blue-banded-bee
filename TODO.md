## Rate Limiting Fix

**Priority: High**
**Status: COMPLETED**

### Issue

Rate limiting not working correctly in production environment. All requests are getting through without 429 responses.

### Implementation Done

1. Added `getClientIP` function to extract the real client IP address:
   - Checks X-Forwarded-For header first
   - Then X-Real-IP
   - Falls back to RemoteAddr with port stripped
2. Updated rate limiter middleware to:
   - Use the real client IP
   - Add logging when rate limits are exceeded
   - Track rate limit events in Sentry
3. Improved health check response by adding newlines

### Testing Required

1. Deploy changes to production
2. Test with concurrent requests from same IP
3. Verify 429 responses after limit exceeded
4. Check logs to confirm correct IP detection

### Success Criteria

- Rate limiter correctly identifies unique IPs
- Returns 429 status after 5 requests per second
- Proper logging and monitoring in place
