# Changelog

All notable changes to the Blue Banded Bee project will be documented in this
file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Multiple version updates may occur on the same date, each with its own version
number. Each version represents a distinct set of changes, even if released on
the same day.

## Release Automation

When merging to main, CI automatically creates releases based on the changelog:

- `## [Unreleased]` or `## [Unreleased:patch]` → Patch release (0.6.4 → 0.6.5)
- `## [Unreleased:minor]` → Minor release (0.6.4 → 0.7.0)
- `## [Unreleased:major]` → Major release (0.6.4 → 1.0.0)

On merge, CI will:

1. Calculate the new version number
2. Replace the heading with `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Add a new `## [Unreleased]` section above
4. Create a git tag and GitHub release
5. Commit the updated changelog

    `POST /v1/organisations/switch` (switch active org)
  - Helper functions `GetActiveOrganisation()` and
    `GetActiveOrganisationWithUser()` for consistent org context across handlers
  - `GetEffectiveOrganisationID()` provides backward compatibility (returns
    active org if set, otherwise legacy `organisation_id`)

### Security

- **Scheduler Jobs Query**: Fixed missing `organisation_id` filter in
  `getSchedulerJobs` query that could potentially expose jobs across
  organisations

### Changed

- **Organisation Scoping**: All 19 API endpoints now filter data by user's
  active organisation (4 dashboard, 8 jobs, 5 schedulers, 2 new org endpoints)
- **Stricter Validation**: Users without an organisation now receive HTTP 400
  "User must belong to an organisation" instead of empty results

## [0.18.10] – 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Compressed Sitemap Support**: ParseSitemap now handles gzip-compressed
  sitemaps (.xml.gz files and Content-Encoding: gzip responses)
  - Automatic detection via URL suffix or response header
  - Requests gzip encoding from servers for bandwidth savings

### Changed

- **Storage Optimisation**: Reduced unnecessary data storage in tasks table
  - `source_url` now only stored for 'link' source type (pages discovered from
    other pages); empty for 'sitemap' and 'manual' sources
  - `redirect_url` now only stored for significant redirects (different domain
    or path); trivial redirects (HTTP→HTTPS, www→non-www, trailing slash) no
    longer stored

## [0.18.9] – 2025-12-29

## [0.18.8] – 2025-12-27

## [0.18.7] – 2025-12-25

### Changed

- **Restart Job Simplification**: Frontend now handles job restart via standard
  creation endpoint
  - Restart button fetches existing job config and POSTs to `/v1/jobs`
  - Preserves: domain, find_links, concurrency, max_pages (with sensible
    defaults if missing); resets: use_sitemap=true
  - Removed backend `StartJob` and `restartJob` functions (~700 lines deleted)
  - Eliminates duplicate job creation logic and missing field bugs
  - **Breaking**: Restart endpoint removed and PUT actions restricted:
    - `/v1/jobs/:id/restart` endpoint no longer exists
    - `PUT /v1/jobs/:id` now only accepts `action="cancel"` (start/restart
      actions removed)
    - To restart a job: fetch config via `GET /v1/jobs/:id`, then
      `POST /v1/jobs` with the retrieved settings

## [0.18.6] – 2025-12-25

### Added

- **API Endpoints**: Added `/restart` and `/cancel` endpoints for job management

### Enhanced

- **Worker Notification**: Workers are now notified immediately after task
  creation for faster job processing
- **Robots.txt Handling**: Use default `*` rules and ignore SEO bot-specific
  rules for improved crawling
- **Robots.txt Delay**: Apply 50% multiplier to robots.txt crawl-delay values
  for more conservative rate limiting

### Fixed

- **Job Cancellation**: Fixed race condition in job cancellation logic
- **CancelJob Endpoint**: Now returns database errors properly
- **Crawl Delay**: Fixed multiplier logic to correctly override stored delay
  values
- **Deadlock Retry**: PostgreSQL deadlock errors (40P01) now correctly trigger
  transaction retry

## [0.18.5] – 2025-12-24

## [0.18.4] – 2025-12-24

## [0.18.3] – 2025-12-24

## [0.18.2] – 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Job Details Metadata**: Display additional job configuration in overview
  grid
  - Concurrency, max pages, and source type from jobs table
  - Crawl delay and adaptive delay from domains table

### Enhanced

- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Faster delay recovery and smarter task claiming
  - Reduced probe threshold from 20 to 5 consecutive successes before attempting
    lower delay
  - Reduced delay step from 1s to 500ms for finer-grained adjustments
  - Recovery from 21s → 10s adaptive delay now takes ~5.5 minutes instead of ~59
    minutes
  - Added `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY_STEP_MS` environment variable for operational
    tuning
- **Worker Task Claiming**: Workers now skip domains that aren't available yet
  - Added `EstimatedWait()` method to DomainLimiter for checking domain
    availability
  - Workers check domain availability before claiming tasks, allowing them to
    work on other jobs instead of blocking
  - Optimised lock contention by snapshotting job info cache before iteration

### Fixed

- **Job Details Page Task Filters**: Fixed non-functional filter buttons and
  search input on job details page
  - Added missing `cacheFilter` and `pathFilter` state properties
  - Implemented path keyword search with 300ms debounce (min 3 characters)
  - Fixed filter coordination so selecting status/cache filters clears path
    search and vice versa
  - Hit/Miss cache filter buttons now work correctly
- **Console Log Noise**: Removed verbose dashboard refresh logging
  - Eliminated "Refreshing dashboard data..." log message
  - Removed "Dashboard data refreshed" log with stats object
- **Password Strength Warning**: Silenced "Password strength checking not
  available" console warning on pages without signup forms
  - setupPasswordStrength() now exits silently when signup form elements aren't
    present
  - Password strength checking still works correctly on actual signup forms

## [0.18.1] – 2025-12-22

## [0.18.0] – 2025-12-22

### Added

- Recurring job scheduling system with support for 6, 12, 24, and 48-hour
  intervals
- Scheduler management API endpoints (`/v1/schedulers`) for creating, updating,
  deleting, and listing schedules
- Dashboard UI for managing schedules with enable/disable, view jobs, and delete
  functionality
- Schedule dropdown in job creation modal to optionally create recurring
  schedules
- Background scheduler service that checks for ready schedules every 30 seconds
  and creates jobs automatically
- Jobs created from schedulers are linked via `scheduler_id` and marked with
  `source_type='scheduler'`

### Fixed

- Replaced string error comparisons with sentinel errors
  (`ErrSchedulerNotFound`) for proper error handling
- Fixed N+1 query pattern in `startJobScheduler` by batching domain name lookups
- Added `GetDomainNames()` and `GetDomainNameByID()` helper functions to
  eliminate duplicate domain lookup code
- Improved validation: `ScheduleIntervalHours` now uses pointer type for
  explicit optional updates in API requests
- Added comprehensive aria-labels to all interactive elements in dashboard for
  improved accessibility
- Extracted time formatting logic into reusable `formatNextRunTime()` helper
  function

### Changed

- Scheduler API now uses pointer types for optional update fields to make intent
  explicit (nil = no update, value = update requested)
- Domain lookups now use consistent helper functions across scheduler code,
  eliminating inline queries

## [0.17.13] – 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Default job concurrency increased from 5 to 20 for dashboard/API jobs and from
  3 to 20 for webhook jobs; maximum allowed concurrency raised from 20 to 100.
- Dashboard auto-refresh interval reduced from 10 seconds to 1 second.
- Job details page now auto-refreshes every 1 second while job is
  running/pending, stopping automatically when job completes.
- Workers now stagger startup by 50ms each to prevent thundering herd on cold
  start and scale-up events.

### Added

- Concurrency dropdown added to dashboard job creation form with "Default"
  option (uses server default of 20) plus values 1-100.
- Webhook endpoint now accepts optional `?concurrency=N` query parameter to
  override the default concurrency for Webflow-triggered jobs.

### Removed

- Removed manual refresh interval dropdown from dashboard form (auto-refresh is
  now always enabled at 1 second).

## [0.17.12] – 2025-11-16

## [0.17.11] – 2025-11-16

## [0.17.10] – 2025-11-16

### Changed

- Batch manager now defaults to a 2 s flush interval with a 2000-item channel,
  and both settings can be tuned via `BBB_BATCH_MAX_INTERVAL_MS` and
  `BBB_BATCH_CHANNEL_SIZE` (clamped to 100‑10 000 ms and 500‑20 000 items) to
  absorb heavy task churn without blocking workers.
- Running task slot releases flush pending batches before falling back to a
  direct `DecrementRunningTasksBy` call, and the fallback timeout was extended
  (15 s) to avoid spurious "DecrementRunningTasksBy database error" warnings
  during spikes.
- CLI auth flow now has a dedicated `cli-login.html` that reuses the Supabase
  modal without leaking users' sessions, and the helper
  (`scripts/auth/cli_auth.py`) drives browser-based login, handles CORS
  securely, and caches tokens for load test scripts.

## [0.17.9] – 2025-11-15

## [0.17.8] – 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- Queue worker now inspects per-job counters before removing jobs, requeues
  stale running tasks, promotes waiting work into pending slots, and
  auto-completes jobs whose tasks finished—eliminating the stuck task warnings
  seen in Sentry.
- `CreatePageRecords` processes discovered links in ≤250 item batches using a
  single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE RETURNING` upsert, preventing
  long-running transactions and the "transaction already committed"/timeout
  alerts.
- Cloudflare Turnstile signup flow resets tokens on every attempt, retries error
  106010 challenges automatically, and emits `turnstile.*` telemetry to Sentry
  capturing token age, retries, and lifecycle transitions for better
  diagnostics.
- Orphaned task cleanup now batches updates (1000 at a time) to avoid hitting
  statement timeouts on jobs with huge backlogs, eliminating the repeated
  "Failed to cleanup orphaned tasks" log spam.

## [0.17.7] – 2025-11-10

## [0.17.6] – 2025-11-09

## [0.17.5] – 2025-11-09

- Queue claiming:
  - Removed the standalone `jobHasCapacityTx` / `jobHasPendingTasksTx`
    pre-checks (and their `FOR SHARE` locks) so workers no longer lock a job row
    twice before updating `running_tasks`.
  - All concurrency/emptiness checks now happen inside the existing claim CTE,
    eliminating the lock-upgrade deadlocks introduced in the 0.17.0
    optimisations.

## [0.17.4] – 2025-11-09

## [0.17.3] – 2025-11-08

## [0.17.2] – 2025-11-08

- Queue stability improvements:
  - Added `jobs.pending_tasks` / `jobs.waiting_tasks` counters plus a backfill +
    trigger to keep them in sync.
  - `EnqueueURLs` and the idle monitor now read those counters under
    `FOR UPDATE`, so pending slots are computed accurately without scanning
    `tasks`.
  - Worker rebalancer logs aggregated queue depth and demotes overflow pending
    rows using the counters (no more full-table queries).

## [0.17.0] – 2025-11-08

Series of minor optimisations to improve throughput and resource usage.

### Changed

- **Database Connection Pool**: Increased production connection pool from 37 to
  70 max connections (idle: 15 → 20)
  - Utilises available Supabase capacity (90 max connections)
  - Provides better concurrency during load bursts
  - Leaves 20 connections headroom for admin/monitoring
  - With Supavisor transaction pooling: ~150 MB memory impact (70 logical →
    ~10-15 actual connections)

### Enhanced

- **Task Claim Performance**: Optimised hot path with covering indexes and
  capacity pre-checks
  - Added partial indexes on tasks(job_id, priority_score, created_at) and
    jobs(id) with INCLUDE columns
  - Pre-check job capacity before expensive claim query (eliminates wasted CTE
    executions)
  - Replaced COUNT(\*) concurrency checks with EXISTS queries (faster
    short-circuit evaluation)
- **Batch Task Enqueuing**: Improved throughput for bulk task creation
  - Batch INSERT operations for discovered links and sitemap URLs
  - Reduced per-task overhead during link discovery phase
- **Worker Scaling Observability**: Scaling decisions now log their reason,
  worker deltas, and job counts
  - Captures `scale_up`, `scale_down`, and `no_change` outcomes with contextual
    metadata
  - Emergency/idle scale-down paths surface cooldowns, idle worker counts, and
    total job concurrency
- **Waiting Task Telemetry**: Added structured logging + metrics for tasks
  entering the `waiting` state
  - Records waiting reason (`concurrency_limit`, `blocking_retry`,
    `retryable_error`) and per-job counts via OpenTelemetry counter
  - Worker retries now emit explicit waiting reason logs to correlate backlog
    with root cause
- **Job Info Fetching**: Worker pool now deduplicates database lookups for job
  metadata via singleflight caching
  - Concurrent AddJob/prepareTask calls share the same DB query for domain info
  - Cache fallbacks reuse the same loader, eliminating redundant queries under
    load
- **Priority Update Debounce**: Prevents redundant sitemap/link priority updates
  during bursts
  - High-priority pages still update immediately; mid-tier waits 5s, low-tier
    30s between updates
  - Skips DB work when no lower-priority tasks exist or when cooldown is active
- **Job Info Cache Metrics**: Added hit/miss/invalidation counters and
  cache-size gauge
  - Worker pool logs cache hits/misses per job and exposes Grafana-friendly
    metrics for dashboarding

### Added

- **Load Test Analysis**: Comprehensive documentation of 82-minute 10x load test
  results
  - Documented priority update storm, waiting task backlog, worker scaling,
    cache behaviour, DB transactions
  - Resource utilisation analysis (Supabase memory/CPU scaling patterns)
  - Phased optimisation recommendations (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- **Database Optimisation Research**: Documented query performance bottlenecks
  and index recommendations
  - CTE claim query analysis (~53% total time), running_tasks counter contention
    (~20%), INSERT conflicts (~19%)
  - Covering index recommendations, batch update strategies, connection pooling
    guidance
- **Pages Lookup Index**: Added composite index on `pages(domain_id, path)` to
  accelerate path lookups during task enqueue and deduplication

### Removed

- **Legacy Load Test Scripts**: Deleted outdated `load-test-simple.sh` and
  README in favour of generate-test-jobs utility

## [0.16.13] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- **Orphaned Task Cleanup**: Resolved systemic issue where orphaned tasks from
  failed jobs weren't being cleaned up
  - Moved cleanup from 60-second maintenance transaction to dedicated goroutine
    running every 30 seconds
  - Processes entire jobs at once with no timeout constraint (eliminates O(n²)
    trigger overhead risk)
  - Handles jobs with 50,000+ orphaned tasks without timing out
  - Fixed job selection query: replaced invalid `SELECT DISTINCT` with `EXISTS`
    subquery (PostgreSQL incompatibility with `ORDER BY` + `FOR UPDATE`)
  - Fixed CancelJob to mark both 'pending' and 'waiting' tasks as skipped
    (previously only handled 'pending')
  - Added comprehensive integration tests covering failed job cleanup, cancelled
    job exclusion, and incremental processing
  - Expected impact: Prevents 16,000+ task backlogs from accumulating over weeks

## [0.16.12] – 2025-11-07

### Changed

- **Dependency Refresh**: Bumped key libraries to their latest stable releases
  before launch
  - sentry-go 0.32.0 → 0.36.2, golang-jwt/jwt/v5 5.2.2 → 5.3.0, pgx/v5 5.7.5 →

    0.14.0
  - Prometheus stack (common, procfs, otlptranslator) and grpc/genproto/
    protobuf modules updated to latest patch levels
  - Miscellaneous indirect upgrades (xmlquery/xpath, bitset, objx, go-difflib,
    go-edlib, OTel auto SDK) via `go get -u ./...`

## [0.17.0] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

  response.WriteHeader" warnings in production logs
  - Upgraded otelhttp from v0.54.0 to v0.63.0 (includes fix from PR #6055)
  - Fixed known bug in otelhttp response writer wrapper
    (open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib#6053)
  - Warnings were occurring on static file routes (/, /robots.txt, /dashboard)

### Changed

- **OpenTelemetry Upgrade**: Major update to observability stack
  - Core OTel packages: v1.32.0 → v1.38.0 (6 minor versions)
  - OTel SDK: v1.32.0 → v1.38.0

  - Zero performance impact when not in debug mode

## [0.16.11] – 2025-11-07

## [0.16.10] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Job Checking**: Fixed job duplicate checking for users without
  organisations
  - Previously checked `user_id IS NULL AND organisation_id = $1` when user had
    no organisation, causing check to fail
  - Now uses `user_id = $1 AND organisation_id IS NULL` to correctly match
    user-created jobs
  - Prevents false duplicate job creation for users without organisation
    assignments

### Added

- **Organisation Auto-Join**: Business email users now automatically join
  existing organisations
  - Added `GetOrganisationByName()` for case-insensitive organisation lookup
  - Added `isBusinessEmail()` to distinguish business vs personal email domains
  - When users sign up with business emails (e.g., `@teamharvey.co`), they
    automatically join existing organisation instead of creating duplicate
  - Personal email users continue to get individual organisations
  - Example: Second user signing up with `@acme.com` joins existing "Acme"
    organisation

- **Smart Organisation Names**: Organisation names now intelligently derived
  from email addresses
  - Business emails derive org name from domain: `simon@teamharvey.co` →
    "Teamharvey"
  - Personal emails with full name use the name: `user@gmail.com` + "John Doe" →
    "John Doe"
  - Personal emails without name use email prefix: `simon.smallchua@gmail.com` →
    "Simon.Smallchua Organisation"
  - Supports common TLDs (.com, .co.uk, .com.au, .io, .ai, .dev, .net, .org)
  - Recognises personal email providers: Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo, iCloud,
    ProtonMail, AOL, Zoho, Fastmail

## [0.16.9] – 2025-11-05

## [0.16.8] – 2025-11-04

## [0.16.7] – 2025-11-04

### Fixed

- **Worker Pool Error Logging**: Fixed spurious error logs for concurrency
  blocking in `GetNextTask` retry wrapper
  - Added check for `ErrConcurrencyBlocked` before error logging at retry
    summary level
  - Eliminates "Error getting next pending task" logs when tasks are blocked by
    concurrency limits
  - Completes the fix from 0.16.6 - now all code paths handle concurrency
    blocking gracefully

## [0.16.6] – 2025-11-03

### Fixed

- **Worker Pool Query Spam**: Fixed critical issue where workers hammered
  database with 200+ queries/second during concurrency blocking
  - Workers now detect when all pending tasks are blocked by job concurrency
    limits (`ErrConcurrencyBlocked`)
  - `claimPendingTask` gracefully handles concurrency-blocked jobs without error
    logging
  - Exponential backoff (200ms → 5s) applied when tasks exist but are
    concurrency-blocked
  - Expected impact: Reduce database queries from ~3,600/sec to <20/sec during
    high concurrency blocking
  - Prevents CPU throttling and machine restarts from excessive query load
  - Maintains same throughput - only reduces wasteful database polling

## [0.16.5] – 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Idle Worker Scaling & Health Probe**: Automatic worker pool management to
  reduce database query spam during concurrency blocking
  - Idle worker tracking scales down workers when all are idle and no work is
    available (configurable via `BBB_WORKER_IDLE_THRESHOLD`, default: disabled)
  - Health probe periodically checks for work to wake idle workers (configurable
    via `BBB_HEALTH_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default: disabled)
  - Calculates needed workers based on effective job concurrency accounting for
    domain throttling
  - Expected impact: ~3,600 queries/sec → <10 queries/sec during idle periods,
    maintaining <30s wake-up latency
  - Both features disabled by default for backwards compatibility

### Fixed

- **Race Conditions in Worker Pool**: Resolved critical concurrency issues in
  idle worker tracking
  - Fixed map panic from concurrent read/write on `idleWorkers` map by capturing
    count inside mutex lock
  - Cleared stale worker IDs during scale-down to prevent perpetual "all idle"
    state causing health probe spam
  - Removed unused `probeJobIndex` field to avoid confusion

## [0.16.4] – 2025-11-03

- Batch manager flushes (including poison-pill fallbacks) now run with 30-second
  contexts so task updates cannot hang indefinitely.
- Added `ExecuteWithContext` with proper retry/backoff and migrated
  `DecrementRunningTasks` plus mocks/tests to honour these deadlines.
- Queue workers now propagate bounded contexts through database writes,
  eliminating silent stalls under load.
- Added a `--log-level` CLI flag that overrides `LOG_LEVEL` for quick production
  debugging.

## [0.16.3] – 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Database Connection Resilience**: Implemented exponential backoff retry
  logic for database connections to prevent crash-looping during Supabase
  maintenance windows
  - Created `internal/db/retry.go` with configurable retry mechanisms
  - Added `WaitForDatabase()` function with up to 5-minute wait period
  - Added `InitFromURLWithSuffixRetry()` for queue database connections
  - Application now gracefully waits for database availability instead of
    crash-looping when Supabase terminates connections (SQLSTATE 57P01)
  - Retry configuration: 10 attempts max, 1s-30s exponential backoff with jitter
  - Prevents Fly.io machine restart exhaustion (observed: 10 restarts over 5
    hours)

## [0.16.2] – 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Pending Queue Overflow**: Fixed pending task queue flooding to 2,673 tasks
  (should be 50-100)
  - Root cause analysis identified three critical issues causing queue overflow:
    1. Unlimited concurrency jobs (NULL/0) set availableSlots to number of pages
       (hundreds/thousands)
    2. Task retries bypassed pending queue cap by going directly to 'pending'
       status
    3. Domain limiter concurrency overrides ignored when calculating available
       slots
  - **Fix #1**: Capped unlimited concurrency jobs to maximum 100 pending tasks
  - **Fix #2**: Routed all retry paths (blocking errors 403/429/503 and
    retryable errors) through 'waiting' status instead of directly to 'pending'
    - Added `TaskStatusWaiting` constant to task status enum
    - Modified retry logic in worker.go to set status to 'waiting' instead of
      'pending'
    - Ensures retries respect the pending queue capacity cap
  - **Fix #3**: Implemented domain limiter concurrency override support in
    availableSlots calculation
    - Added `ConcurrencyOverrideFunc` callback mechanism to DbQueue
    - Created `GetEffectiveConcurrency()` method on DomainLimiter to expose
      adaptive throttling limits
    - Modified `EnqueueURLs()` to query domain name and apply
      `min(configuredConcurrency, limiterOverride)`
    - Prevents over-promotion when domains are being adaptively throttled
  - Updated unit tests to match new SQL query pattern with domain JOIN
  - Expected improvement: Pending queue stays at 50-100 tasks instead of
    flooding to 2,600+

## [0.16.1] – 2025-11-02

## [0.16.0] – 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Queue Performance Bottleneck**: Eliminated GetNextTask query performance
  degradation causing 5ms-107s variance (21,000x)
  - Root cause: Query scanned ~5,000 pending tasks looking for jobs with
    available concurrency, causing table scan under load
  - Introduced 'waiting' status for tasks blocked by job concurrency limits
  - Only 'pending' tasks are now eligible for claiming, reducing typical scan
    from 5,000 rows to <100 rows (98% reduction)
  - Added capacity-aware enqueueing:
    `available_slots = concurrency - (running_tasks + existing_pending_count)`
  - New tasks only set to 'pending' if job has available capacity slots,
    remainder go to 'waiting'
  - Migration includes backfill UPDATE to immediately move existing blocked
    pending tasks to waiting status
  - DecrementRunningTasks now automatically promotes one waiting task to pending
    when capacity frees
  - Created partial indexes `idx_tasks_pending_ready` and
    `idx_tasks_waiting_by_job` for optimised scans
  - Added database functions `promote_waiting_task_for_job()` and
    `job_has_capacity()` for atomic state transitions
  - Expected improvement: Query times from 5-107s to consistent <10ms, reduced
    pool contention, improved throughput

### Added

- **Adaptive Domain Rate Limiter**: Shared per-domain throttle with persistence
  and concurrency management to prevent 429 cascades
  - Learns delays based on blocking responses and writes them back via
    `adaptive_delay_seconds` / `adaptive_delay_floor_seconds`
  - Applies shared backoff windows, linear (+1 s) growth, probing after
    sustained success, and concurrency reduction for heavily throttled domains
  - Configurable via `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_BASE_DELAY_MS`,
    `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_DELAY_SECONDS`, `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD`, and
    `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES`
- **Queue Status Flow Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of task
  lifecycle and status split solution
  - Visual state machine diagrams showing pending/waiting/running/completed
    transitions
  - Capacity calculation examples with concrete scenarios
  - Query performance before/after comparisons with scan size analysis
  - Implementation details for capacity-aware enqueueing and atomic promotion
  - Edge case handling documentation (no concurrency limit, concurrent
    completions, migration timing)
- **Job Failure Guardrail**: Worker pool stops jobs after configurable
  consecutive task failures (`BBB_JOB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, default 20) to
  preserve resources when domains remain blocked indefinitely

## [0.15.0] – 2025-10-29

### Added

- Optional `DATABASE_QUEUE_URL` so the worker queue can use a dedicated
  session-mode Postgres connection while the rest of the app remains on the
  pooled endpoint
- Workflow flag `[preview app]` now opt-in deploys GitHub PR preview apps;
  previews are skipped by default to reduce noise

### Changed

- Introduced an in-process semaphore and bounded retry/backoff logic around the
  task queue transactions (`DB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `DB_TX_MAX_RETRIES`,
  `DB_TX_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`, `DB_TX_BACKOFF_MAX_MS`) to keep Supabase from
  saturating under bursts
- Startup now reuses the shared pool for general queries while routing queue
  traffic through the optional connection, improving resilience during deploys
- Cache-warming second crawls now use a 500–1000 ms jittered delay with only
  three lightweight HEAD probes, cutting typical task time from ~17 s to under
  8 s

### Fixed

- Cleaned up recent migration churn (`running_tasks` counter column, timing
  columns, job status CTE) so all environments apply schema changes without
  manual intervention

## [0.14.2] – 2025-10-29

## [0.14.1] – 2025-10-26

## [0.14.0] – 2025-10-26

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Throughput**: Eliminated 5-second batch delay bottleneck in task
  claiming
  - Decoupled `running_tasks` counter decrement from batch updates for immediate
    concurrency slot release
  - Workers now claim tasks immediately after completion instead of waiting for
    batch flush (up to 5 seconds)
  - Added atomic `DecrementRunningTasks()` function to `DbQueueInterface` for
    immediate counter updates
  - Removed counter decrements from all 4 batch update queries (completed,
    failed, skipped, pending)
  - Batch manager continues to handle detailed field updates efficiently (95%
    transaction reduction maintained)
  - Expected improvement: 15-20 tasks/min → ~180 tasks/min (12× throughput
    increase)
  - Single atomic UPDATE per task completion adds negligible database load
  - Both success and error paths now decrement counters immediately for
    consistent behaviour

### Changed

- **Database Connection Tracking**: Enhanced connection management and cleanup
  - Added application name tracking for connection identification in PostgreSQL
  - Implemented automatic cleanup of stale connections from previous deployments
    on startup
  - Enhanced connection string builder with parameter sanitisation and
    validation
  - Added support for detecting and terminating idle connections from previous
    application instances
  - Connection strings now include `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` and
    `statement_timeout` for stability

## [0.13.0] – 2025-10-25

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant database queries during link
  discovery
  - Cached `domain_id` in job info to avoid per-task lookups (50+ queries/second
    reduction)
  - Reduced connection pool pressure by 15-20% during high-throughput operations
  - Added defensive guard for missing domain context to prevent silent failures
  - Enhanced test coverage with explicit assertions for domain ID propagation

### Fixed

- **Pool Saturation During Link Discovery**: Workers no longer hit connection
  pool limits when processing discovered links
  - Root cause: Each completed task queried `SELECT domain_id FROM jobs`
    individually
  - Solution: Domain ID now flows through cached job info → task → link
    processing
  - Impact: Link enqueueing now succeeds consistently, enabling full crawl depth

## [0.12.3] – 2025-10-25

## [0.12.2] – 2025-10-25

## [0.12.1] – 2025-10-25

  concurrent job processing
  - Added 9 foreign key indexes reducing lock wait times from 2-6s to <100ms
    (20x improvement)
  - Optimised RLS policies wrapping auth.uid() in SELECT for 10,000x reduction
    in per-row evaluation overhead
  - Refactored task claiming to use single CTE query combining SELECT + UPDATE
    (50% fewer round trips)
  - Split RLS policies for shared resources: relaxed INSERT for workers, strict
    SELECT via jobs, UPDATE restricted to service role only
  - Expected improvements: 2x task throughput (400-550/min → 800-1,000/min),
    2-10x concurrent job capacity (5 → 10-50+)

## [0.11.1] – 2025-10-24

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Timezone Handling**: Jobs now display correctly in user's local
  timezone instead of UTC
  - Added automatic timezone detection using browser's IANA timezone string
    (e.g., "Australia/Sydney")
  - Backend converts "today"/"yesterday" boundaries to user's timezone with
    graceful UTC fallback
  - Added "Last Hour" and "Last 24 Hours" rolling window filters alongside
    existing calendar-day filters
  - URL-encodes timezone parameter to handle special characters (`Etc/GMT+10` →
    `Etc%2FGMT%2B10`)
  - Applied to both bb-auth-extension.js and bb-components.js integration paths

## [0.11.0] – 2025-10-24

### Enhanced

- **Batch Task Status Updates**: Implemented PostgreSQL batch UPDATE system
  reducing database transactions by 95% (3000/min → 60/min)

## [0.10.1] – 2025-10-22

## [0.10.0] – 2025-10-22

### Fixed

- **Connection Pool Exhaustion and Deployment Crashes**: Fixed database
  connection exhaustion causing application crashes
  - Changed deployment strategy from rolling to immediate (stops old machine
    before starting new)
  - Prevents attempting 90 connections during deploys (old + new machine)
  - Eliminates "remaining connection slots reserved for SUPERUSER" errors
  - Brief downtime (~30-60s) during deploys is acceptable trade-off
- **Recovery Batch Timeouts**: Increased statement timeout for maintenance
  operations
  - Increased statement timeout from 30s to 60s for recovery batches
  - Increased context timeout from 35s to 65s to accommodate longer queries
  - Fixes persistent timeout errors when recovering 1,000+ stuck tasks

### Changed

- **Environment-Based Resource Scaling**: Worker pools and database connections
  now scale based on APP_ENV environment variable

  - **Preview/Staging**: 10 workers (max 10), 10 max connections, 4 idle
    connections
  - **Development**: 5 workers (max 50), 3 max connections, 1 idle connection
  - Dynamic worker scaling enforces environment-specific limits in AddJob and
    performance-based scaling
  - Prevents preview apps from scaling beyond their connection pool capacity
  - Prevents resource exhaustion during PR testing
  - Stays well under Supabase's 48-connection pool limit
  - Development uses minimal connections to allow multiple local instances

## [0.9.1] – 2025-10-20

## [0.9.0] – 2025-10-20

### Fixed

- **Task Recovery System**: Rewrote stuck task recovery to use batch processing
  - Processes stuck tasks in batches of 100 (oldest first) preventing
    transaction timeouts
  - Failed batches use exponential backoff and bail out after 5 consecutive
    failures to prevent database hammering
  - Tasks from cancelled/failed jobs are marked as failed immediately instead of
    retrying
  - Increased maintenance statement timeout from 5s to 30s to allow recovery
    batches to complete when processing large backlogs
  - Fixes issue where thousands of tasks could remain stuck indefinitely due to
    all-or-nothing transaction rollbacks
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Reduced Sentry event spam whilst improving alert
  quality
  - Reduced stuck task monitoring from every 5 seconds to every 5 minutes
  - Replaced per-task Sentry events with single aggregated alert reporting

## [0.6.8] – 2025-10-11

## [0.6.7] – 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- **Cache Warming Improvement Calculation**: Fixed "Improved Pages" incorrectly
  showing 100% when cache was already warm
  - Changed logic from `second_response_time < response_time` to
    `second_response_time > 0 AND second_response_time < response_time`
  - Pages with `second_response_time = 0` (already cached) are no longer counted
    as "improved"
  - Improvement rate now accurately reflects pages actually warmed by this job
  - Stats calculation version bumped to v4.0

## [0.6.6] – 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- **Job Metrics Calculation**: Fixed response time metrics displaying 0ms when
  cache warming is perfectly effective

    `0` as valid value instead of falling back to first request times
  - Now uses `NULLIF(second_response_time, 0)` to convert instant cache hits
    (0ms) to NULL, enabling fallback to meaningful first-request metrics
  - Recalculates existing jobs with buggy v1.0 or v2.0 stats automatically on
    migration
  - Stats calculation version bumped to v3.0

## [0.6.5] – 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- **Share Link API**: Return 200 with exists flag instead of 404 when no link
  exists
  - Changed GET /v1/jobs/:id/share-links to return 200 with `{"exists": false}`
    when no share link exists
  - Returns 200 with `{"exists": true, "token": "...", "share_link": "..."}`
    when link exists
  - Updated frontend to check exists field instead of 404 status
  - Eliminates console errors and provides cleaner API semantics

## [0.5.29] – 2025-07-26

### Added

- **Sitemap Fallback**: Falls back to crawling from root page when sitemap
  unavailable
- **Database Migrations**: Transitioned to migration-based database management

## [0.5.28] – 2025-07-19

### Fixed

- **Memory Leak**: Removed unbounded in-memory HTTP cache that was causing
  memory exhaustion during crawl jobs. The cache was storing entire HTML pages
  without eviction, leading to out-of-memory crashes.

## [0.5.27] – 2025-07-19

### Enhanced

- **DB Optimisation**: Implemented a bunch of indexes on Supabase tables and
  deleted all historical data on pages/domains/tasks/jobs to clean and speed up.

## [0.5.26] – 2025-07-07

### Enhanced

- **Crawler Efficiency**: Implemented an in-memory cache for the HTTP client
  used by the crawler. This significantly reduces bandwidth and speeds up
  crawling by preventing the repeated download of assets (like JavaScript and
  CSS) within the same crawl job.

## [0.5.25] – 2025-07-06

### Github action updates

- **Codecov**: Implemented integration to report on testing coverage, indicated
  in badge in README
- **Go Report**: Added code quality reporting into README

## [0.5.24] – 2025-07-06

### Security

- **CSRF Protection**: Implemented global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  protection by adding Go 1.25's experimental `http.CrossOriginProtection`
  middleware to all API endpoints. This hardens the application against
  malicious cross-origin requests that could otherwise perform unauthorised
  actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

## [0.5.23] – 2025-07-06

### Added

- **Performance Debugging**: Implemented Go's built-in flight recorder
  (`runtime/trace`) to allow for in-depth performance analysis of the
  application in production environments. The trace data is accessible via the
  `/debug/fgtrace` endpoint.

### Fixed

- **Flight Recorder**: Corrected the flight recorder's shutdown logic to ensure
  `trace.Stop()` is called during graceful server shutdown instead of
  immediately on startup. This allows the recorder to capture the full
  application lifecycle, making it usable for production performance debugging.

## [0.5.22] – 2025-07-03

### Enhanced

- **Database Performance**: Implemented an in-memory cache for page lookups
  (`pages` table) to significantly reduce redundant "upsert" queries. This
  dramatically improves performance during the page creation phase of a job by
  caching results for URLs that are processed multiple times within the same
  job.

## [0.5.21] – 2025-07-03

### Changed

- **Database Driver**: Switched the PostgreSQL driver from `lib/pq` to the more
  modern and performant `pgx`.
  - This resolves underlying issues with connection poolers (like Supabase
    PgBouncer) without requiring connection string workarounds.
  - The `prepare_threshold=0` setting is no longer needed and has been removed.
- **Notification System**: Rewrote the database notification listener
  (`LISTEN/NOTIFY`) to use `pgx`'s native, more robust implementation, improving
  real-time worker notifications.

### Enhanced

- **Database Performance**: Optimised the `tasks` table indexing for faster
  worker performance.
  - Replaced several general-purpose indexes with a highly specific partial
    index (`idx_tasks_pending_claim_order`) for the critical task-claiming
    query.
  - This significantly improves the speed and scalability of task processing by
    eliminating expensive sorting operations.

### Fixed

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Fixed an issue where the new `pgx`-based notification
  listener would not terminate correctly during a graceful shutdown, preventing
  the worker pool from stopping cleanly.

## [0.5.20] – 2025-07-03

### Added

- **Cache Warming Auditing**: Added detailed auditing for the cache warming
  retry mechanism.
  - The `tasks` table now includes a `cache_check_attempts` JSONB column to
    store the results of each `HEAD` request check.
  - Each attempt logs the cache status and the delay before the check.

### Enhanced

- **Cache Warming Strategy**: Improved the cache warming retry logic for more
  robust cache verification.
  - Increased the maximum number of `HEAD` check retries from 5 to 10.
  - Implemented a progressive backoff for the delay between checks, starting at
    2 seconds and increasing by 1 second for each subsequent attempt.

### Fixed

- **Database Connection Stability**: Resolved a critical issue causing
  `driver: bad connection` and `unexpected Parse response` errors when using a
  connection pooler (like Supabase PgBouncer).
  - The PostgreSQL connection string now includes `prepare_threshold=0` to
    disable server-side prepared statements, ensuring compatibility with
    transaction-based poolers.
  - Added an automatic schema migration (`ALTER TABLE`) to ensure the
    `cache_check_attempts` column is added to existing databases.

## [0.5.19] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **Task Prioritisation**: Refactored job initiation and link discovery for more
  accurate and efficient priority assignment.
  - The separate, post-sitemap homepage scan for header/footer links has been
    removed, eliminating a redundant HTTP request and potential race conditions.
  - The homepage (`/`) is now assigned a priority of `1.000` directly during
    sitemap processing.
  - Link discovery logic is now context-aware:
    - On the homepage, links in the `<header>` are assigned priority `1.000`,
      and links in the `<footer>` get `0.990`.
    - On all other pages, links within `<header>` and `<footer>` are ignored,
      preventing low-value navigation links from being crawled repeatedly.
    - Links in the page body inherit their priority from the parent page as
      before.

## [0.5.18] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **Crawler Efficiency**: Implemented a comprehensive visibility check to
  prevent the crawler from processing links that are hidden. The check includes
  inline styles (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`), common utility classes
  (`hide`, `d-none`, `sr-only`, etc.), and attributes like `aria-hidden="true"`,
  `data-hidden`, and `data-visible="false"`. This significantly reduces the
  number of unnecessary tasks created.

## [0.5.17] – 2025-07-02

### Added

- **Task Logging**: Included the `priority_score` in the log message when a task
  is claimed by a worker for improved debugging.

### Fixed

- **Crawler Stability**: Fixed an infinite loop issue where relative links
  containing only a query string (e.g., `?page=2`) were repeatedly appended to
  the current URL instead of replacing the existing query.

## [0.5.16] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **User Registration**: The default organisation name is now set to the user's
  full name upon registration for a more personalized experience.
- **Organisation Name Cleanup**: Organisation names derived from email addresses
  are now cleaned of common TLDs (e.g., `.com`), ignores generic domains, and
  doesn't capitalise.

### Fixed

- **Database Efficiency**: Removed a redundant database call in the page
  creation process by passing the domain name as a parameter.
- **Task Auditing**: Ensured that the `retry_count` for a task is correctly
  preserved when a task succeeds after one or more retries.

## [0.5.15] – 2025-07-02

### Changed

- **Codebase Cleanup**: Numerous small changes to improve code clarity,
  including fixing comment typos, removing unused code, and standardising
  function names.
- **Worker Pool Logic**: Simplified worker scaling logic and reduced worker
  sleep time to improve responsiveness.

### Fixed

- **Architectural Consistency**: Corrected a flaw where the `WorkerPool` did not
  correctly use the `JobManager` for enqueueing tasks, ensuring
  duplicate-checking logic is now properly applied.

### Documentation

- **Project Management**: Updated `TODO.md` to convert all file references to
  clickable links and consolidated several in-code `TODO` comments into the main
  file for better tracking.
- **AI Collaboration**: Added `gemini.md` to document the best practices and
  working protocols for AI collaboration on this project.
- **Language Standardisation**: Renamed `Serialize` function to `Serialise` to
  maintain British English consistency throughout the codebase.

## [0.5.14] – 2025-06-26

### Added

- **Task Prioritisation Implementation**: Implemented priority-based task
  processing system
  - Added `priority_score` column to tasks table (0.000-1.000 range)
  - Tasks now processed by priority score (DESC) then creation time (ASC)
  - Homepage automatically gets priority 1.000 after sitemap processing
  - Header links (detected by common paths) also get priority 1.000
  - Discovered links inherit 80% of source page priority (propagation)
  - Added index `idx_tasks_priority` for efficient priority-based queries
  - All tasks start at 0.000 and only increase based on criteria

### Enhanced

- **Task Processing Order**: Changed from FIFO to priority-based processing
  - High-value pages (homepage, header links) crawled first
  - Important pages discovered early get higher priority
  - Ensures critical site pages are cached before less important ones

### Fixed

- **Recrawl pages with EXPIRED cache status**

## [0.5.13] – 2025-06-26

### Added

- **Task Prioritisation Planning**: Created comprehensive plan for
  priority-based task processing
  - PostgreSQL view-based approach using percentage scores (0.0-1.0)
  - Minimal schema changes - only adds `priority_score` column to pages table
  - Homepage detection and automatic highest priority assignment
  - Link propagation scoring - pages inherit 80% of source page priority
  - Detailed implementation plan in
    [docs/plans/task-prioritization.md](docs/plans/_archive/task-prioritisation.md)

### Enhanced

- **Job Duplicate Prevention**: Cancel existing jobs when creating new job for
  same domain
  - Prevents multiple concurrent crawls of same domain
  - Automatically cancels in-progress jobs for domain before creating new one
  - Improves resource utilisation and prevents redundant crawling

- **Cache Warming Timing**: Adjusted delay for second cache warming attempt
  - Increased delay to 1.5x initial response time for better cache propagation
  - Added randomisation to cache warming delays for more natural traffic
    patterns

  detection) and second request (cache verification) to allow CDNs time to
  process and cache the first response
- **Webflow Webhook Domain Selection**: Fixed webhook to use first domain
  (primary/canonical) instead of last domain (staging .webflow.io)
- **Webflow Webhook Page Limits**: Removed 100-page limit for webhook-triggered
  jobs - now unlimited for complete site cache warming

### Fixed

    domain)
- **Job Source Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of job creation sources for
  debugging and analytics
  - `source_type` field: `"webflow_webhook"` or `"dashboard"`
  - `source_detail` field: Clean display text (publisher name or action type)

    details)

### Enhanced

- **Job Creation Architecture**: Refactored to eliminate code duplication
  - Extracted shared `createJobFromRequest()` function for consistent job
    creation

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Scaling**: Improved auto-scaling for better performance and bot
  protection
  - Simplified worker scaling from complex job-requirements tracking to simple
    +5/-5 arithmetic per job
  - Auto-scaling: 1 job = 5 workers, 2 jobs = 10 workers, up to maximum 50
    workers (10 jobs)
  - Each job gets dedicated workers preventing single-job monopolisation and bot
    detection risks
- **Database Connection Pool**: Increased to support higher concurrency
  - MaxOpenConns: 25 → 75 connections to prevent bottlenecks with increased
    worker count
  - MaxIdleConns: 10 → 25 connections for better connection reuse
- **Crawler Rate Limiting**: Reduced aggressive settings for better politeness
  to target servers
  - MaxConcurrency: 50 → 10 concurrent requests per crawler instance

### Technical Implementation

- **Simplified Scaling Logic**: Removed complex `jobRequirements` map and
  maximum calculation logic
  - `AddJob()`: Simple `currentWorkers + 5` with max limit of 50
  - `RemoveJob()`: Simple `currentWorkers - 5` with minimum limit of 5
  - Eliminated per-job worker requirement tracking for cleaner, more predictable
    scaling

## [0.5.8] – 2025-06-03

### Added

    verification
  - Supabase can calculate cache warming success (`cache_warmed`) using:
    `second_cache_status = 'HIT'`

### Fixed

- **Critical Link Extraction Bug**: Fixed context handling bug that was
  preventing all link discovery
  - Link extraction was defaulting to disabled when `find_links` context value
    wasn't properly set
  - Now defaults to enabled link extraction, fixing pagination link discovery
    (e.g., `?b84bb98f_page=2`)
  - **TODO: Verify this fix works by testing teamharvey.co/stories pagination
    links**
- **Link Extraction Logic**: Consolidated to Colly-only crawler to extract only
  user-clickable links
  - Removed overly aggressive filtering that was blocking legitimate navigation
    links
  - Now only filters empty hrefs, fragments (#), javascript:, and mailto: links
- **Dashboard Form**: Fixed max_pages input field to consistently show default
  value of 0 (unlimited)

### Enhanced

- **Code Architecture**: Eliminated logic duplication in cache warming
  implementation
  - Cache warming second request reuses main `WarmURL()` method with
    `findLinks=false`
  - Removed redundant `cache_warmed` field - can be calculated in
    Supabase/dashboard
  - Database schema includes cache warming columns in initial table creation for
    new installations

  - Tasks beyond limit automatically set to 'skipped' status during creation
  - Added `skipped_tasks` column to jobs table and Job struct
  - Progress calculation excludes skipped tasks:
    `(completed + failed) / (total - skipped) * 100`
  - API responses include skipped count for full visibility

### Enhanced

### Fixed

- **Job Completion Logic**: Fixed job completion detection for jobs with limits
  - Updated completion checker: `(completed + failed) >= (total - skipped)`
  - Added safety check for division by zero in progress calculations
  - Prevents jobs from being stuck with remaining skipped tasks

### Technical Details

- MaxPages limit of 0 means unlimited processing (default behaviour)
- Task status determined during `EnqueueURLs` based on current task count vs
  max_pages
