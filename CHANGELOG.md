Each version represents a distinct set of changes, even if released on the same day.

## [0.3.7] – 2025-05-18

### Removed
- Removed depth functionality from the codebase:
  - Removed depth column from tasks table schema
  - Removed depth parameter from all EnqueueURLs functions
  - Updated code to not use depth in task processing

  - Simplified code by removing unused functionality

## [0.3.6] – 2025-05-18

### Fixed
- Fixed job counter updates for `sitemap_tasks` and `found_tasks` columns:

  - Implemented incrementing of found task counter for URLs discovered during crawling
  - Fixed duplicate processing issue by moving the page processing mark after successful task creation
  - Updated job query to properly return counter values
- Improved task creation reliability by ensuring pages are only marked as processed after successful DB operations

## [0.3.5] – 2025-05-17

### Changed

  - Eliminated duplicate code across the codebase
  - Removed global state in favor of proper dependency injection

  - Removed `jobs/queue_helpers.go` (consolidated functionality)
  - Removed global state management with `SetDBInstance`
  - Eliminated duplicate SQL operations

## [0.3.4] – 2025-05-17

### Added
- Enhanced sitemap crawling with improved URL handling
- Added URL normalization in sitemap processing

## [0.3.3] – 2025-04-22

### Added

- Added `sitemap_tasks` and `found_tasks` columns to the `jobs` table and corresponding fields in the Job struct
- Enqueued discovered links (same-domain pages and document URLs) via link extraction in the worker pool

### Changed

- `processTask` now filters `result.Links` to include only same-site pages and docs (`.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`) and enqueues them
- Updated `setupSchema` to include new columns with `ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Exposed `Crawler.Config()` method to allow workers to read the `FindLinks` flag

### Documentation

## [0.3.2] – 2025-04-21

### Changed

- Improved database configuration management with validation for required fields
- Enhanced worker pool notification system with more robust connection handling
- Simplified notification handling in worker pool with better error recovery

## [0.3.1] – 2025-04-21

### Changed

- Fixed documentation file references in INIT.md and README.md to use explicit relative paths
- Updated ROADMAP.md references to point to root directory instead of docs/
- Ensured consistent file linking across documentation

## [0.3.0] – 2025-04-20

### Added

- New `domains` and `pages` reference tables for improved data integrity
- Helper methods for domain and page management
- Added depth control for crawling with per-task depth configuration

### Removed

- Removed legacy `crawl_results` table and associated code.
- Removed unused functions and methods to improve code maintainability
- Eliminated deprecated code including outdated `rand.Seed` usage

### Changed

- Restructured documentation under `docs/` directory.
- Added limit to site crawl to control no of pages to crawl.
- Modified `jobs` table to reference domains by ID instead of storing domain names directly
- Updated `tasks` table to use page references instead of storing full URLs
- Refactored URL handling throughout the codebase to work with the new reference system

### Fixed

- Correctly set job and task completion timestamps (`CompletedAt`) when tasks and jobs complete.
- Fixed "append result never used" warnings in database operations
- Resolved unused import warnings and other code quality issues
- Fixed SQL parameter placeholders to use PostgreSQL-style numbered parameters (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) instead of MySQL/SQLite-style (`?`)
- Fixed task processing issues after database reset by ensuring consistent parameter style in all SQL queries
- Corrected parameter count mismatch in batch insert operations

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-20

### Changed
